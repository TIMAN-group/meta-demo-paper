\section{Usability}

\meta/ is hosted publicly on Github\footnotemark[1], which provides
the project with community involvement through its bug/issue tracker and
fork/pull request model. Its API is heavily documented\footnotemark[2] and the
project website contains several tutorials that cover the major aspects of
the toolkit\footnotemark[3] to enable users to get started as fast as
possible with little friction.

A major design point in \meta/ is to allow for most of the functionality to be
configured via a configuration file. This enables exploratory data analysis
without having to write (or recompile) any code. Designing the code in this way
also encourages the components of the system to be pluggable: the entire
indexing process, for example, consists of several modular layers which can be
controlled by the configuration file.

A simple class hierarchy allows users to add filters, analyzers, ranking
functions, and classifiers with full integration to the toolkit (\emph{e.g.} one
may specify user-defined classes in the config file). The process for adding
these is detailed in the \meta/ online tutorials.

Multi-language support is hard to do correctly. Many toolkits sidestep this
issue by only supporting ASCII text or the OS language; \meta/ supports multiple
(non-romance) languages by default, using the industry standard ICU
library\footnotemark[4]. This allows \meta/ to tokenize arbitrarily-encoded text
in nearly any language.

Unit tests ensure that contributors are confident that their modifications do
not break the toolkit. Unit tests are automatically run after each commit and
pull request, so developers immediately know if there is an issue (of course,
unit tests may be run manually before committing). The unit tests are run in a
continuous integration setup where \meta/ is compiled and run on
Linux\footnotemark[77], Mac OS X\footnotemark[77], and Windows\footnotemark[78]
under a variety of compilers and software development configurations.
