\section{Conclusions}

We have shown \meta/ is a valuable resource for text mining applications; it is
a viable alternative to existing toolkits and unifies algorithms from natural
language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. This allows
one extensible, consistent framework to replace the many disparate alternatives.
